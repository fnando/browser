Do some browser detection with Ruby. Includes ActionController integration.

== Installation

  gem install browser

== Usage

  require "rubygems"
  require "browser"

  browser = Browser.new(:ua => "some string", :accept_language => "en-us")
  browser.safari?
  browser.opera?
  browser.mobile?
  browser.firefox?
  browser.ie?
  browser.ie6?              # this goes up to 9
  browser.capable?          # supports some CSS 3
  browser.full_capable?     # supports more CSS 3
  browser.platform          # return :mac, :windows, :linux or :other
  browser.mac?
  browser.windows?
  browser.linux?
  browser.meta              # an array with several attributes
  browser.to_s              # the meta info joined by space

See the tests for more examples.

=== Rails integration

Just add it to the Gemfile or `environment.rb`, depending of your Rails version.

  gem "browser"         #=> Rails 3
  config.gem "browser"  #=> Rails 2

This adds a helper method called `browser`, that inspects your current user agent.

  <% if browser.ie6? %>
    <p class="disclaimer">Your're running an older IE version. Please update it!</p>
  <% end %>
